# FilmRoulette
WatchSomething--DesktopVersion

(Basically a continuation of WatchSomething (WebAPP)

Decided to pause learning Node.js and work on a java app in preparation for my internship in the summer (2017)

Used TMDB(The Movie Database) for all movie information, and a wrapper api by holgerbrandl(www.github.com/holgerbrandl)
UI build with JavaFX, hopefully I can make it look prettier in the future. 

Changelog:
Version 1.0:
Fully working version of FilmRoulette!
Gonna demo to OpenWeb members to get some feedback on ui/look/feel/info/etc
Updated with executable Jar file. 


Current Version: 1.0.0
Known Bugs:
1. High volume of text in OVERVIEW part essentially pushes down the submit button.             
   - Currently trying to find a way to set a max length for Text
2. Trailer button will not work for Movies with no trailer. Need a way to fix
3. Going to try and figure out a good UI color palette for the desktop app. Might be a bit hard since there could be clash with posters

Changelog:
Version 1.0.1:
Fixed the issue with text in overfiew pushing down submit button.
Hopefully on Monday 9/11/17 I can demo to Open Web.
